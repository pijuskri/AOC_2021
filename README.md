<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project
<div id="about-the-project"></div>

My approach to the <a href="https://adventofcode.com/2021/">advent of code challenge</a>,
which is a set of puzzles that get revealed every day for the month of december.

I choose to start this challenge not to learn programming ( i've done plenty of algos in uni already :) ),
but to remember programming, as my current minor in university has nothing to do with programming at all.
Also i've always been interested in Scala and with the recent release of Scala of 3 this was
a good opportunity to learn more about the language.

Sadly i can't incorporate things like Spark or Flink in this project, but i will make myself a challenge to use as much
functional programming as possible


### Built With
<div id="built-with"></div>

* [Scala 3](https://www.scala-lang.org/)

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
### Prerequisites
<div id="prerequisites"></div>

* [Scala 3.1](https://www.scala-lang.org/download/scala3.html)


### Getting Started
<div id="getting-started"></div>

The code is currently all in one file called "Main". The "object Main extends App" part of the file
is the main function and the output of any day can be printed there. Each day has 2 corresponding functions, name in 
day(number of day)_(task number), so the solution to day 5 and task 2 can be called with ```day5_2()```

### Progress
<div id="progress"></div>

December 22 - until day 11 is done

### To do (besides the puzzles)
<div id="todo"></div>

* Add description to every solution to explain it
* Separate day solutions into separate files
* Add interface to call any function
